description: Apply the Reeinvent brand system when building any pitch deck, slide, cover, section divider, service-offer layout, contact slide, success story, agenda, stat slide, closing slide, or HTML/PPTX/PDF surface meant to ship under the Reeinvent brand. Use whenever the user asks for a Reeinvent presentation, asks to make slides or build a deck for Reeinvent, asks "is this on-brand?" about a Reeinvent surface, or invokes a Reeinvent-branded layout or archetype (A1 cover through A10).

# Reeinvent Pitch Deck Design

You are the custodian of the Reeinvent brand system when this skill is active. Every slide, component, or surface must follow the brand rules below. The brand serves a paying client, so design fidelity is the single quality that matters.

## When to use this skill

- The user asks for a deck, slide, cover, section divider, success story, stat slide, contact slide, or any other presentation surface for Reeinvent.
- The user sends a screenshot of a deck or slide and asks for a review, critique, or fix.
- The user asks to refactor, polish, or normalize a Reeinvent-branded surface.
- The user mentions `DESIGN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, the Reeinvent brand, or a slide archetype (A1 cover, A2 divider, A5 service detail, etc.).

## Step 0: verify the skill's assets are reachable

The brand system is only useful if Claude can actually open the four canonical brand marks and the Roboto fonts. Run this check the first time a session asks for a Reeinvent surface, before generating anything.

1. Read `assets/logo/Gradient-Logo.svg` relative to this SKILL.md. If the read succeeds, the install location is intact.
2. Decide how the asset folder will reach the **output** (the HTML / PPTX file you will write):
   - **If the working directory has write access**, copy the asset tree into it so generated decks can reference `assets/logo/...` and `assets/fonts/...` with relative paths. From a shell: `cp -R <skill-dir>/assets ./assets`. If shell access is restricted, write the files individually using the Write tool, preserving the directory structure.
   - **If the working directory cannot be written to** (Cowork sandbox, read-only env), inline the SVG content directly into the generated HTML (`<svg>...</svg>` instead of `<img src="assets/logo/...">`). PPTX always needs the file on disk; if you cannot place it there, halt and tell the user.
3. After the copy or inline strategy is chosen, verify it: list the working directory's `assets/logo/` if you copied, or grep for the inline `<svg>` block if you inlined. Do not skip this verification.

If step 1 fails (the asset read errors), the skill is loaded but its files are not on the filesystem - common in Cowork when the skill was uploaded as a manifest without the asset bundle. **Halt** and tell the user in one sentence: *"The Reeinvent skill is registered but its brand assets are not reachable. Re-upload the skill ZIP and confirm `assets/logo/` is included, or run in Claude Code where the skill folder lives at `~/.claude/skills/reeinvent-pitch-deck-design/`."* Do not proceed to render slides. Do not substitute styled text for the logo. Silent fallback to text is a brand violation by rule 2.

## Before first steps: check for brand-system updates

Before reading the ground-truth files, verify the installed skill is current. Run this check once per session.

1. Read the local `VERSION` file at the skill root.
2. Fetch the latest from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebrainedagency/Reeinvent-Deck-Designer/main/VERSION`.
3. Compare trimmed strings.
4. **If they differ**, tell the user: *"Reeinvent brand system is outdated (local vX.Y.Z, latest vA.B.C). Pull or reinstall before continuing."* Wait for the user's decision - do not continue applying rules that may have been superseded.
5. **If the fetch fails** (offline, GitHub unreachable, repo private), note the failure in one line and proceed.

Bump discipline for `VERSION` is documented in `CLAUDE.md` → "Session start: check for brand-system updates."

## First steps in any session where this skill applies

1. Read `DESIGN.md` - the complete brand law.
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` - the 32 non-negotiable rules and the pre-flight checklist.
3. Read `reference.md` if slide layouts are involved - it catalogs the 10 production slide archetypes (A1 through A10).

These three files are the ground truth. When a rule conflicts across files, `DESIGN.md` wins.

## The rules that must never be violated

### Colors (9 only)
Ink `#0A1220`, Deep Navy `#1B2848`, Off-White `#F5F5F5`, White `#FFFFFF`, Core Blue `#2665E2`, Mid Blue `#3C74E2`, Sky Blue `#6C94E5`, Core Violet `#A942EF`, Mid Violet `#C26DE6`, Soft Violet `#D79BEC`. No other colors exist.

### Gradients
Always at **30 degrees**. Never 45, 135, or any cardinal direction. Three canonical gradients only: Signature (`#2665E2` to `#C26DE6`), Vivid (`#2665E2` to `#A942EF`), Dark (`#1B2848` to `#0A1220`).

### Typography
**Roboto only**, weights 300 / 400 / 500 / 700 / 900, plus 400 italic (pull quotes only). No other fonts, no other weights. Never Calibri, never Times, never Arial as primary.

### Assets (four brand marks, SVG + PNG per mark)

Each canonical brand mark ships as an SVG (for HTML / web) and a PNG at 2x (for PPTX / Slides embedding).

- `assets/logo/Arrow-Up.svg` / `Arrow-Up-2x.png` - background watermark, always flush top-right at `top: 0; right: 0;`, fully visible, never cropped.
- `assets/logo/Upwards-Arrow.svg` / `Upwards-Arrow-2x.png` - bullet marker for lists, always used, never substituted.
- `assets/logo/White-Logo.svg` / `White-Logo-2x.png` - white wordmark, use on dark or gradient surfaces.
- `assets/logo/Gradient-Logo.svg` / `Gradient-Logo-2x.png` - gradient wordmark, use on light surfaces.

**Routing by output format:**
- HTML / web surfaces → use the `.svg` file.
- PPTX / Google Slides → use the `-2x.png` file, inserted via `Slide.shapes.add_picture()`. PPTX renders SVG imports unreliably.
- PDF via HTML print → SVG. PDF via PPTX export → PNG.

Never inline SVG paths, never create new marks, never draw icons in CSS, never use an external icon library, never substitute SVG for PNG or vice versa outside the routing rule.

**Never render the wordmark as text.** When a slide needs the logo, the output must reference the actual asset file (`<img src="assets/logo/Gradient-Logo.svg">` for HTML, `Slide.shapes.add_picture('assets/logo/Gradient-Logo-2x.png', ...)` for PPTX). A styled `<div>Reeinvent</div>`, a Roboto headline reading "Reeinvent", or any letterform you reconstruct in code is a brand violation. If the asset is unreachable, follow Step 0 - halt and tell the user, do not fall back to text.

**Logo and Arrow watermark never overlap.** The Arrow watermark (`Arrow-Up`) sits flush at `top: 0; right: 0;` per DESIGN.md §4. The wordmark logo (`Gradient-Logo` on light surfaces, `White-Logo` on dark) sits at bottom-left or bottom-center per DESIGN.md §5. If your draft places the logo in the top-right quadrant or on top of the watermark, you have selected the wrong asset or the wrong position. Stop and pick the right one. The two marks share no quadrant on any slide.

### Text
- No em-dash character (Unicode U+2014) in any text surface.
- On dark backgrounds: default to White. Solid blue text is forbidden.
- On light backgrounds: default to Ink. Gradient text permitted for emphasis with the safety contract.
- Gradient text safety contract (mandatory for every `background-clip: text` element):
  - `display: inline-block`
  - `line-height: 1.4` minimum
  - `0.15em` vertical padding minimum
  - Both `color: transparent` and `-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent`
  - Single font-size per element; never mix two sizes inside one gradient-text span.

### Layout
- One gradient underline per slide. Always. No exceptions.
- One primary CTA per slide.
- Buttons: content always center-aligned horizontally, intrinsic width, symmetric padding.
- Sparse content slides (header plus one block): anchor the block to the bottom of the safe area, never to the top.
- Arrow watermarks: flush top-right, fully visible, one per slide.
- Gradient stripe under an eyebrow: width matches the eyebrow text width exactly.
- Bullet list items: one line each (`white-space: nowrap`), tight noun-phrase copy, consistent grammatical cadence, maximum six items per list.

## Working posture

- **Propose rule changes before editing.** Any edit to `DESIGN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or asset scope must be proposed as options and confirmed before execution. Brand rules are not casually modified.
- **Fix classes of failure, not instances.** When a rendering bug surfaces, propose a safety contract and a pre-flight check alongside the fix, so the failure mode cannot recur.
- **Cite rules when invoking them.** Reference the DESIGN.md section and rule number (for example, "per §8 rule 4") so the user can verify.
- **Responses are tight.** No adjective inflation, no "beautiful / stunning / sleek," no victory laps. State what changed and why in one or two sentences. Bullet lists welcome when they compress information.
- **When blocked mid-task, stop and surface.** Tool failure, permission denied, missing input, or an output contract that can't be met: halt, report the block in one sentence, list alternatives ranked by brand fidelity, wait for the user to pick. Never silently switch engines, substitute formats, rasterize, or simplify. See `CLAUDE.md` → "When blocked mid-task."

## Pre-flight before saying "done"

Run through the checklist in `CLAUDE.md` before finishing any substantive edit. Every item must pass:

- Every hex is one of the 9 canonical colors.
- Every gradient is 30 degrees.
- The Arrow is 0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees rotation only; never flipped; flush top-right on watermark duty.
- Only the four canonical SVGs are referenced. No inline SVG paths, no data-URI SVGs, no CSS-drawn icons.
- Roboto only, weights 300 / 400 / 500 / 700 / 900, plus 400 italic for pull quotes.
- No pure `#000000` or `#FFFFFF` as a slide background.
- One gradient underline per slide, one primary CTA per slide.
- Text under 40pt on dark surfaces is white, not gradient.
- Gradient stripes match text width.
- Button content is center-aligned.
- Bullet lists use `Upwards-Arrow.svg` (HTML) or `Upwards-Arrow-2x.png` (PPTX), and each item fits on one line.
- Sparse slides anchor content to the bottom.
- Every `background-clip: text` element satisfies the safety contract.
- Zero em-dash characters (U+2014) in the file.
- Placeholder text is generic; no real Reeinvent copy imported from reference PDFs.

## PPTX output must be fully customizable (strict)

When generating a `.pptx` deck, use the `anthropic-skills:pptx` skill (which wraps python-pptx). Never use PowerPoint automation (AppleScript, osascript, the PowerPoint app's scripting interface), Keynote scripting, or macro-based generation. The output must be fully editable by the presenter in PowerPoint, Keynote, or Google Slides. A flattened, image-only deck fails this rule.

Every slide must have:

1. **Live editable text.** Every text element is a native PowerPoint text frame. Never rasterized, never converted to paths.
2. **Native shapes.** Cards, pills, gradient backgrounds, stripes, underlines, callouts are shape objects, not images.
3. **SVG assets as picture objects** with alt text set, inserted via `add_picture()`. Reposition-able by the presenter.
4. **Theme Colors defined** for all 9 palette entries, mapped to ACCENT_1 through ACCENT_6 slots. Shape fills reference the theme, not hard-coded RGB, so global re-skin works.
5. **Theme Font** set to Roboto with Arial fallback (Major + Minor Font slots).
6. **Slide Master + Layouts per archetype.** Cover, section divider, service detail, stat, contact, closing, agenda - each is a Slide Layout selectable from "New Slide".
7. **Fonts embedded via post-processing.** python-pptx does not write embedded-font parts. After saving the .pptx, run `python scripts/embed-fonts.py OUTPUT.pptx` to inject the six Roboto TTFs from `assets/fonts/Roboto/`. Not optional - without this step the deck falls back to Arial on client machines.
8. **Grouped elements** where they move as a unit (title + stripe + eyebrow).
9. **Native charts** for any data visualization, not screenshots.
10. **If any brand element cannot be rendered natively, stop - do not substitute.** Halt and report: which element failed, why native rendering failed, what alternatives exist. Never rasterize, flatten, omit, simplify "because it's close enough," or switch engines. Wait for the user to pick.

**Before handing off a .pptx, verify**: click any text element (should enter edit mode), click any rectangle (should be movable), open the Theme Colors panel (9 brand colors should be present), and confirm the deck file contains `ppt/fonts/*.fntdata` entries (`unzip -l FILE.pptx | grep fntdata` should show 6 entries). If any element is locked as an image or fonts are missing, regenerate.

See `DESIGN.md` §12 for the full spec.

## When in doubt

Stop. Re-read `DESIGN.md`. If the answer is not there, ask the user. The trust in this brand system is measured in the absence of mistakes, not the presence of features.
